      "tition by adopting digital touchpoints. However, the academic literature offers little in terms of what determines customers’\n",
      "behavioral intentions toward e-service touchpoints. Therefore, drawing from the dominant design theory, this article first\n",
      "conceptually adapts selected dominant touchpoints of leading e-commerce solutions to BaM retail. Then 250 shoppers are\n",
      "surveyed regarding the likeliness that they will use the selected touchpoints, followed by an exploratory factor analysis to\n",
      "determine the touchpoints’ characteristics that lead to the shoppers’ assessments. The results suggest that customers prefer\n",
      "touchpoints that support product search and selection, provide information, and increase shopping efficiency. The likeliness that\n",
      "surveyed shoppers will use the touchpoints was affected by the functionality provided, the content conveyed, and the mediating\n",

Now some traditional, less-digitalized brick and mortar (BaM) retailers are starting to counteract the increasing compe-\\ntition by adopting digital touchpoints. However, the academic literature offers little in terms of what determines customers’\\nbehavioral intentions toward e-service touchpoints. Therefore, drawing from the dominant design theory, this article first\\nconceptually adapts selected dominant touchpoints of leading e-commerce solutions to BaM retail. Then 250 shoppers are\\nsurveyed regarding the likeliness that they will use the selected touchpoints, followed by an exploratory factor analysis to\\ndetermine the touchpoints’ characteristics that lead to the shoppers’ assessments. The results suggest that customers prefer\\ntouchpoints that support product search and selection, provide information, and increase shopping efficiency. The likeliness that\\nsurveyed shoppers will use the touchpoints was affected by the functionality provided, the content conveyed, and the mediating\\ndevice. The results provide a foundation for further research on customers’ behavioral intentions toward BaM e-service\\ntouchpoints and provide useful information for BaM retailers.\\n</p>\\n<p>Keywords Brick andMortar .

Acceptance\\n</p>\\n<p>Introduction\\n</p>\\n<p>How retailers and customers interact is constantly changing.\\nThe advent of omni-channel retailing made clear that custom-\\ner interaction does not stop at a particular channel’s bound-\\naries (Lemon and Verhoef 2016; Saghiri et al. 2017), as ex-\\nemplified by hybrid customer interactions, where customers\\nuse digital and physical channels in parallel (Hosseini et al.\\n2017; Nüesch et al. 2015).\\n</p>\\n<p>With the emergence of smart retail technologies (Roy et al.\\n2017) that blur the boundaries between physical and digital\\nchannels (Roy et al. 2018), the number of touchpoints (TPs) a\\nretailer must manage is increasing (Lewis et al. 2014; von\\nBriel 2018). While the use of information and communication\\ntechnology to improve processes has a long history in brick\\nand mortar (BaM) retail, front-stage interactions with cus-\\ntomers have primarily been based on person-to-person inter-\\naction (Betzing et al. 2018). In contrast, e-commerce, by def-\\ninition, is built upon customer contact via e-service\\ntouchpoints (eTPs). Service is the application of competencies\\n“through deeds, processes, and performances for the benefit of\\nanother entity or the entity itself” (Vargo and Lusch 2008, p.\\n26), which, when conveyed through a digital interface, is\\n</p>\\n<p>This article is part of the Topical Collection on Digital Transformation\\nand Service\\n</p>\\n<p>Responsible Editors: Christiane Lehrer and Daniel Beverungen\\n</p>\\n<p>* Benjamin Barann\\nbenjamin.barann@ercis.uni-muenster.de\\n</p>\\n<p>Jan H.

In this article,\\neTPs are assumed to be classes of TPs (Heuchert et al. 2018)\\nwith e-commerce functionalities. For example, an online shop\\nmight provide access to product-comparison TPs. Trends like\\n“bricks-and-clicks,” where TPs from stationary channels are\\nadapted to e-commerce settings (Herhausen et al. 2015), allow\\nonline retailers to improve their existing eTPs and innovate\\nnew ones (e.g., Garnier and Poncin 2019; Jiyeon Kim and\\nForsythe 2008a, 2008b). The e-commerce industry has gained\\nexperience with eTPs over the last two decades, so it can be\\nassumed that e-commerce has converged toward a set of dom-\\ninant eTPs that appear in most online shops (cf. Suárez 2004).\\n</p>\\n<p>Retailers that operate exclusively in the BaM channel face\\npressure to innovate their TPs since the digital transformation\\nhas profoundly impacted the competitive market structure in\\nfavor of e-commerce and digital retail business models (V.\\nKumar et al. 2017; Verhoef et al. 2015). In addition, cus-\\ntomers’ expectations regarding digital services offered by\\nBaM retailers are increasing (Blázquez 2014; Bollweg et al.\\n2020; Hagberg et al. 2016). To create customer value, retailers\\ncan choose from a wide variety of technologies and eTPs\\n(Vargo and Lusch 2008; Voorhees et al. 2017; Willems\\net al. 2017), but doing so is challenging, as their introduction\\ncarries risks and uncertainties (Pantano 2014), and BaM re-\\ntailers have little guidance regarding what eTPs to implement.\\nResearch lacks clarity regarding customers’ intentions to use\\neTPs in BaM retail stores. While research investigates cus-\\ntomers’ acceptance of various eTPs in e-commerce,1 most\\nstudies on channel choice suggest that customers’ behavior\\nin e-commerce and BaM retail differs (Schramm-Klein et al.\\n2007). However, only a few studies give advice regarding\\nindividual technologies and online practices that can be of-\\nfered in the physical retail servicescape.2 To fill this gap, this\\narticle investigates customers’ behavioral intentions toward\\nBaM eTPs.\\n</p>\\n<p>Customers are likely to be familiar with the most prominent\\neTPs in e-commerce, so it can be argued that comparable eTPs\\nfor physical stores are a good starting point for BaM retailers\\nto meet customers’ ever-changing expectations and a suitable\\nsubject for investigation. Therefore, the first research question\\nis:\\n</p>\\n<p>RQ1: Are customers likely to use eTPs, which have been\\nadopted from e-commerce and adapted to BaM retail?\\n</p>\\n<p>Furthermore, to determine the likeliness that customers will\\nuse such adapted eTPs in BaM retail stores, this manuscript\\naims at assessing what TP characteristics determine cus-\\ntomers’ interest in the eTPs. Thus, the second research ques-\\ntion is:\\n</p>\\n<p>RQ2: Is the likeliness that customers will use these e-\\nservice touchpoints af fected by the touchpoints ’\\ncharacteristics?\\n</p>\\n<p>An exploratory sequential multi-method approach\\n(Creswell 2013; Mingers 2003) was used to answer these\\nresearch questions and provide a broad overview of eTPs for\\nBaM retail stores. First, a set of dominant eTPs offered by\\nleading e-commerce platforms was selected, and each TP\\nwas adapted for use in the physical BaM servicescape.\\nSecond, a quantitative survey (Recker 2013) was fielded to\\n250 potential shoppers to determine the likeliness that they\\nwould use the candidate eTPs in a BaM context. Next, the\\ndeterminants of the likeliness that customers would use the\\neTPs were subject to statistical tests and an exploratory factor\\nanalysis (Fabrigar et al. 1999) to reveal the unobserved TP\\ncharacteristics that led to the survey results. Related to studies\\nthat focus on the overarching channels and interfaces, this\\nwork explores the determinants of customers’ behavioral in-\\ntentions toward eTPs in BaM retail stores. The exploratory\\nresults suggest that customers’ intentions to use various kinds\\nof BaM eTPs vary and are affected by their characteristics.\\nTherefore, further research that considers the individual TPs\\nnext to more coarse-grained concepts is justified, as is whether\\nto treat groups of eTPs that have common characteristics\\nsimilarly.\\n</p>\\n<p>The remainder of this article unfolds as follows: First, the\\nresearch background is introduced, followed by an explana-\\ntion of the research approach. Then the eTPs are adapted, and\\nthe survey results are presented to address RQ1. Next, RQ2 is\\naddressed by revealing the results of the exploratory factor\\nanalysis. The penultimate section discusses the findings, and\\nfinally, the article concludes with a summary, a discussion of\\nthe study’s limitations, and opportunities for further research.\\n</p>\\n<p>Research background\\n</p>\\n<p>Optimizing the customer experience requires companies to\\ntake a fine-grained view of all the TPs its customers have with\\nthem (von Briel 2018). Omni-channel management uses “a\\nsynergetic management” (Verhoef et al. 2015, p. 176) of\\nTPs across all available channels to improve their overall per-\\nformance. However, according to Becker and Jaakkola (2020,\\np. 637), customer experiences are all “non-deliberate, sponta-\\nneous responses and reactions to particular stimuli,” which\\ncannot be directly created. Instead, they suggest that a com-\\npany can define intended experiences, design TP stimuli ac-\\ncordingly, and manage the customers’ TP encounters that\\n</p>\\n<p>1 For example: Kim and Stoel (2005), Asosheha et al.

Research offers various versions of what constitutes\\nthe TP and the channel (e.g., Berendes et al. 2018; Kronqvist\\nand Leinonen 2019; Richardson 2010). The channel usually\\nrefers to a particular medium that facilitates the interaction\\nbetween a company and its customers (Halvorsrud et al.\\n2016; Neslin et al. 2006). The concepts of offline, online/dig-\\nital, and mobile channels describe collections of related me-\\ndia, such as online shops and social media, which are specific\\ndigital channels or TPs (e.g., Hickman et al. 2019; Jocevski\\net al. 2019; Straker et al. 2015). Others understand TPs as\\nindividual channels or media (e.g., Baxendale et al. 2015;\\nLim et al. 2015; Straker et al. 2015), actualmoments of contact\\nor encounters that constitute customer journeys (e.g.,\\nHalvorsrud et al. 2016; Homburg et al. 2017; Verhoef et al.\\n2015), and perceptible stimuli that offer the potential for en-\\ncounters (e.g., S. Davis and Longoria 2003; Kronqvist and\\nLeinonen 2019; Richardson 2010). This article follows a dif-\\nferentiated understanding (e.g., Berendes et al. 2018; Følstad\\nand Kvale 2018; Heuchert et al. 2018; Kronqvist and\\nLeinonen 2019) and defines the customer touchpoint as “a\\nstimulus fulfilling a specific role within the customer journey.\\nIt has an interface, which grants access to the stimulus and is\\nmediated by a human, an analog object, or a technology situ-\\nated in a physical or digital sphere. When encountering a\\ntouchpoint, a message between the customer and the retailer,\\nits brand, or other customers is transmitted. This encounter\\ncauses a customer experience” (Barann et al. 2020, p. 7 in\\npreprint). The customer journey is a process or path made up\\nof a sequence of TPs the customer encounters to use or access\\na service (Becker and Jaakkola 2020; Følstad and Kvale 2018;\\nPatrício et al. 2011). A medium conveys a whole collection of\\nstimuli via an interface like a smartphone application (app) or\\na human-mediated service interface. The medium is subse-\\nquently assigned to a type of channel (Barann et al. 2020).\\n</p>\\n<p>Figure 1 illustrates the hierarchical relationship among the\\nchannel, the medium, the TP interface, and the TP stimuli.\\nEach concept is the subject of its own body of scholarly work.\\nTranscending the hierarchy, research also discusses channel\\nchoice, technology acceptance, and customers’ behavioral in-\\ntentions toward individual TPs.\\n</p>\\n<p>Channel choice in retail\\n</p>\\n<p>In the presence of multiple and integrated channels, under-\\nstanding the determinants of customers’ channel choice be-\\nhavior is a complex issue that is subject to intense research\\n(Galipoglu et al. 2018; Steven et al. 2018; Neslin et al. 2006).\\nResearch finds that marketing efforts, channel attributes, so-\\ncial effects, channel integration, situational factors, and indi-\\nvidual differences among customers, such as previous channel\\nexperience, determine customers’ channel choice (Melero\\net al. 2016; Neslin et al. 2006).\\n</p>\\n<p>As a result of the introduction of new digital channels and\\ntheir increasing interconnections, companies must now ensure\\nthat their channels meet their customers’ requirements for\\neach stage of the customer journey, instead of the customer\\njourney as a whole (Zhao and Deng 2020). Customers choose\\ntheir channels based on the tasks they seek to complete (Maity\\nand Dass 2014), the stage of their customer journey (Frasquet\\net al. 2015; Hummel et al. 2017), and the degree to which a\\nchannel’s attributes are suited to the customer’s shopping\\ngoals (Dholakia et al. 2010). The relevance of the channels’\\nattributes to the customer varies with the situation along the\\njourney. In response, existing research assesses the sequences\\nof choices as parts of customer journeys. The complexity of\\nomni-channel customer journeys makes it a paramount con-\\ncern for researchers and firms to understand customers’\\n</p>\\n<p>Fig. 1 Exemplary Non-Exclusive and Non-Exhaustive Relationships between Channels, Media, Interfaces, and Stimuli.

When\\nthey integrate self-service (e.g., Falk et al. 2007) or other smart\\nretail technologies (e.g., Roy et al. 2018), BaM retailers add\\nnew digital service interfaces to their physical servicescape,\\nimpacting their customers’ perceptions about the channel. For\\nexample, Wagner (2015) finds that the interfaces provided for\\ncustomers to access an electronic channel impact their channel\\nevaluations. Therefore, retailers should not only consider each\\nchannel as a whole but also each channel’s components to\\nunderstand and guide customers’ channel choice.\\n</p>\\n<p>Technology acceptance in brick and mortar retail\\n</p>\\n<p>Customers’ perceptions of value are affected by their in-store\\nexperiences, which themselves are affected by technology. To\\nimprove this experience, the applied technology has to meet\\nthe customers’ expectations and be relevant to them (Blázquez\\n2014). Besides self-service technologies, mobile technologies\\ncan bridge the gap between online and offline channels, as\\nthey can mirror the e-commerce experience in BaM retail\\n(Mirsch et al. 2016). These technologies impact the customer\\njourney and enable the introduction of new TPs (Lemon and\\nVerhoef 2016). To select beneficial technologies (Inman and\\nNikolova 2017), retailers require knowledge about their cus-\\ntomers’ acceptance of these technologies (Pantano 2014). Roy\\net al. (2018, p. 156) suggest academia to “explore customers’\\nacceptance of specific” technologies in more detail.\\n</p>\\n<p>Studies on the acceptance of retail technologies employ the\\nwell-established Technology Acceptance Model (e.g., F. D.\\nDavis 1985, 1989) or the Unified Theory of Acceptance and\\nUse of Technology (Venkatesh et al. 2003, 2012). Such stud-\\nies analyze factors that impact customers’ attitude toward\\n(e.g., Müller-Seitz et al. 2009; Roy et al. 2018), behavioral\\nintention toward (e.g., Chopdar et al. 2018; Müller-Seitz et al.\\n2009; Roy et al. 2018), intention to use (e.g., Aloysius et al.\\n2018; El Azhari and Bennett 2015), and use behavior (e.g.,\\nChopdar et al. 2018; Demoulin and Djelassi 2016) regarding\\nretail technologies like mobile shopping apps (e.g., Chopdar\\net al. 2018; Natarajan et al. 2018), location-based retail apps\\n(e.g., Kang et al. 2015; Uitz and Koitz 2013), Radio-\\nFrequency Identification (RFID) technologies (e.g., Müller-\\nSeitz et al. 2009; Rothensee and Spiekermann 2008), or self-\\nservice technologies (Demoulin and Djelassi 2016; Weijters\\net al. 2007), as well as the in-store use of personal\\nsmartphones (e.g., Mosquera et al. 2018).\\n</p>\\n<p>Studies that address what leads to customers’ acceptance of\\ntechnologies often miss to consider the impact of specific\\nfunctionalities when a generic type of technology or an app\\nthat might be able to fulfill various tasks along the customer\\n</p>\\n<p>journey is the subject of the analysis. Still, some authors have\\nconducted sub-studies that compared BaM technologies that\\noffer certain functionalities (Inman and Nikolova 2017) or\\nhave certain service characteristics (Aloysius et al. 2018).\\nThese studies find that certain functionalities and design char-\\nacteristics of technologies and services affect customers’ per-\\nceptions of technology in BaM retail stores. Natarajan et al.\\n(2018) find that the type of device moderates the effect of\\nvarious variables on the customers’ intentions to use mobile\\nshopping apps. While channel choice is affected by the avail-\\nable interfaces (Wagner 2015), customers’ perceptions of such\\ninterfaces depend on the specific functionalities (Aloysius\\net al. 2018; Inman and Nikolova 2017) and the device used\\n(Natarajan et al. 2018). In retail, the functionalities of, for\\nexample, a smartphone app can be considered TPs intended\\nfor certain stages of the customer journey (Boyd et al. 2019).\\nTherefore, retailers should consider not only each interface as\\na whole but its components (i.e., its eTPs) to understand and\\nguide customers’ technology acceptance.\\n</p>\\n<p>Behavioral intentions toward e-service touchpoints in\\nbrick and mortar retail\\n</p>\\n<p>TPs offer various means of interaction during the customer\\njourney (Boyd et al. 2019; Jocevski et al. 2019). All of the\\nTPs customers encounter during their journeys have “direct\\nand more indirect effects on purchase and other customer be-\\nhaviors” (Lemon and Verhoef 2016, p. 82), so optimizing\\ncustomers’ experiences requires an understanding of what\\ncharacteristics cause these effects (Ponsignon et al. 2017;\\nVerhoef et al. 2015). This article focuses on the factors that\\ndetermine customers’ behavioral intentions toward eTPs in\\nBaM stores. This manuscript understands these behavioral\\nintentions as “the degree to which a person has formulated\\nconscious plans to perform or not perform some specified\\nfuture behavior” (Warshaw and Davis 1985, p. 214), that is,\\nthe likelihood that a person uses a specific eTP as part of a\\nfuture BaM customer journey.\\n</p>\\n<p>Few studies investigate TPs (instead of channels) on a fine-\\ngrained level. Some use the TP concept to discuss various chan-\\nnels, media, or interfaces that belong to channels.3 Few explicitly\\nname and focus on TP stimuli or encounters4 or focus on their\\ncharacteristics.5 Several studies discuss the determinants of cus-\\ntomers’ behavioral intentions toward eTPs in an e-commerce\\ncontext without calling them “touchpoints.”6 Some studies\\n</p>\\n<p>3 For example: Huré et al.

Barann et al.</p>\\n<p />\\n</div>\\n<div class=\"page\"><p />\\n<p>analyze customers’ behavioral intentions toward TPs that are\\nadapted from BaM retail to e-commerce (e.g., Garnier and\\nPoncin 2019; Jiyeon Kim and Forsythe 2008a, 2008b). While\\nmost research on channel choice suggests that the customer be-\\nhavior in e-commerce and BaM retail differs (Cervellon et al.\\n2015; Schramm-Klein et al. 2007), Schramm-Klein et al. (2007)\\nand Walsh et al. (2010) show that customers’ criteria for evalu-\\nating e-commerce and BaM stores are similar but also that cus-\\ntomers’ evaluation of services is significantly more important in\\nonline shops. Still, smart retail technologies in particular (Roy\\net al. 2017; Roy et al. 2018), along with the hybrid customer\\ninteractions they foster (Hosseini et al. 2017; Nüesch et al.\\n2015), unfold a new smart servicescape (Sanjit K. Roy et al.\\n2019) that combines aspects of BaM retail with those of e-com-\\nmerce, leading to a technology-mediated in-store experience\\n(Roy et al. 2017). Therefore, whether results from studies on\\neTPs in e-commerce can be transferred to BaM retail remains\\nin question.\\n</p>\\n<p>However, only a few studies focus on customers’ behav-\\nioral intentions toward eTPs in this hybrid setting, although\\nthey do not use the term TP but use online practices and\\ntechnologies (Lazaris et al. 2015a, 2015b), features (Burke\\n2002), or services (e.g., de Kerviler et al. 2016; Schierz et al.\\n2010), or name the particular TP under consideration. For\\nexample, studies focus on customers’ acceptance of mobile\\ninformation search (de Kerviler et al. 2016), mobile self-\\ncheckout (Johnson et al. 2019), mobile payment (de Kerviler\\net al. 2016; C. Kim et al. 2010; Schierz et al. 2010), mobile\\ncoupons (Liu et al. 2015), mobile recommendation agents\\n(Kowatsch and Maass 2010), mobile marketing (Persaud\\n</p>\\n<p>and Azhar 2012), or specific fashion retail eTPs (H.-Y. Kim\\net al. 2017; Weinhard et al. 2017). Some articles on self-\\nservice technologies (e.g., Aloysius et al. 2018; Demoulin\\nand Djelassi 2016) are concerned with specific self-checkout\\nTPs. Similar to this work, Lazaris et al. (2015a, 2015b) com-\\npare customers’ valuation of various online practices and tech-\\nnologies in BaM retail stores.\\n</p>\\n<p>Not all studies use theoretical constructs to measure cus-\\ntomers’ behavioral intentions toward (e.g., Liu et al. 2015),\\nintentions to use (e.g., de Kerviler et al. 2016; C. Kim et al.\\n2010; H.-Y. Kim et al. 2017), intentions to participate in using\\n(e.g., Persaud and Azhar 2012), or attitudes toward (e.g., de\\nKerviler et al. 2016; H.-Y. Kim et al. 2017; Schierz et al.\\n2010) eTP in BaM retail. Studies indicate that customers’\\nperceptions of, attitudes toward, and behavioral intentions dif-\\nfer across various eTPs (H.-Y. Kim et al. 2017) and that the\\npredictors of their intention to use various TPs also differ (de\\nKerviler et al. 2016; H.-Y. Kim et al. 2017). Lazaris et al.\\n(2015a, 2015b) use two samples in two studies to analyze\\ncustomers’ perceptions of the importance of the same\\ntechnologies and practices applied in BaM retail stores. In\\nboth studies, the groups of eTPs whose ratings are strong or\\nweak are similar, and they find no significant differences in\\nthe subsets of TPs. de Kerviler et al. (2016) also find that the\\nstrength of the spillover between customers’ behavioral inten-\\ntions toward different eTPs is positively related to their\\nsimilarity.\\n</p>\\n<p>While such studies provide first insights into the determi-\\nnants of customers’ behavioral intentions toward eTPs in BaM\\nretail, the literature covers only a small portion of extant BaM\\n</p>\\n<p>Fig. 2 Exemplary Research Perspectives in Channel Choice, TechnologyAcceptance, and Behavioral Intentions Toward Touchpoints (Numbers refer to\\nthe IDs in Table A.1 in Appendix A)\\n</p>\\n<p>Exploring customers’ likeliness to use e-service touchpoints in brick and mortar retail 527</p>\\n<p />\\n</div>\\n<div class=\"page\"><p />\\n<p>eTPs, and there is no consensus about the approach to be used\\nto measure the determinants that cause customers’ behavioral\\nintentions toward eTPs in BaM retail. In summary, then, this\\nexploratory study investigates the factors that determine the\\nlikeliness that customers would use eTPs in BaM retail, that is,\\nhow customers choose the means to communicate, interact,\\nand exchange with other actors, such as the retailer, during\\ntheir BaM customer journeys. Fig. 2 provides an overview of\\nsome of the relationships considered by the interdependent\\nresearch streams at each level. Appendix A provides addition-\\nal details about related works in these literature streams.\\n</p>\\n<p>Research approach\\n</p>\\n<p>Even though doing so is unconventional in the area of infor-\\nmation systems research (Mingers 2001), the posited re-\\nsearch questions ask for a combination of empirical and in-\\nterpretative methods: While assessing the likeliness that cus-\\ntomers would use eTPs (RQ1) implies empirical work, un-\\nderstanding the factors that cause customers to use the TPs\\n(RQ2) requires going beyond quantitative work, so this\\nstudy uses a data-driven (Müller et al. 2016) multi-method\\napproach (Mingers 2003) to address its research questions.\\nThis mix of methods allows for an exploratory discussion of\\nmulti-sourced eTPs candidates that cover both innovative\\n(still theoretical) eTPs and existing and implemented eTPs\\nthat are chosen from an initial qualitative web-content anal-\\nysis. The structure and contextualization of the methods used\\nin the research framework are visualized in Fig. 3. With the\\noutput of each step, typically being the input for its succes-\\nsor, an explanatory, sequential approach is followed\\n(Creswell 2013). This study extends the work of Betzing\\net al. (2019) by using an in-depth analysis to discuss the\\nunderlying factors causing the likeliness that customers\\nwould use eTPs in BaM retail stores, transcending the mere\\ndescriptive ranking of eTPs that are likely to be used.\\n</p>\\n<p>The first step was to identify candidate TPs for the analysis\\nusing a qualitative web-content analysis approach (Mayring\\n</p>\\n<p>2014), following the lens of dominant design theory (Suárez\\nand Utterback 1995) and acknowledging the lack of a formal-\\nly derived list of eTPs for BaM retail in the literature. Through\\nthe systematic analysis of popular e-commerce solutions, a\\nselection of commonly offered eTP candidates with which\\ncustomers are likely to be familiar was selected.\\n</p>\\n<p>To assess the likeliness that customers would use generic\\nBaM eTPs—and not specific e-commerce instantiations (e.g.,\\nthe Amazon shopping cart)—their features were identified to\\nadapt them to BaM retail. In keeping with Beverungen et al.\\n(2011), service blueprints were created to transfer the services\\nfrom one servicescape to the other. These blueprints were also\\nused to support the discussions between the researchers and to\\ninform the survey design.\\n</p>\\n<p>A quantitative survey research approach was followed\\n(Recker 2013) to capture the likeliness that shoppers will use\\nthe BaM eTPs (RQ1) derived in the preceding step. Asmethod\\nadvocates like Bitner et al. (2008) recommend initial training\\nto establish a common understanding of formalized models\\nlike service blueprints, these blueprints would have been un-\\nsuitable for describing the eTPs to survey participants. Hence,\\nsimilar to Inman and Nikolova (2017), Aloysius et al. (2018),\\nand Kleijnen et al. (2007) who used textual descriptions to\\ndescribe technologies or services under investigation, each\\neTP was described by using a less formalized description of\\nthe blueprints, keeping the semantic essence while changing\\nthe syntactical frame. Alternative approaches turned out to be\\ninappropriate, as practical implementations of the eTPs in\\nBaM retail stores are scattered across retailers, and several\\nidentified eTPs still lack a BaM implementation. While lab\\nexperiments would have allowed investigating specific TPs\\non a more detailed and technical level, the description-based\\nsurvey was preferable for three reasons: First, a wider variety\\nof TPs could be covered by avoiding costly prototype\\nimplementations. Second, abstracting from the specifics of\\nthe individual TPs allowed to observe more general TP-\\nspanning characteristics affecting the likeliness that customers\\nwould use them.

To clarify the survey results and\\nprovide a foundation to answer RQ2, an exploratory factor\\nanalysis (EFA) was conducted on the 26 survey items captur-\\ning the likeliness that the participants would use the individual\\neTPs. An EFA is a statistical approach that can be used to\\nidentify the common underlying dimensions or structures of\\nsurvey items by analyzing their interrelationships (Hair et al.\\n2013). In contrast to confirmatory factor analysis, the purpose\\nof which is to evaluate a proposed theory, EFA is used if no\\nprior theory exists (Williams et al. 2010). The factor analysis\\nfound seven unobserved characteristics that caused the vari-\\nance in the data. Finally, to ensure a theoretically grounded\\ninterpretation of these factors, three researchers independently\\ncoded each of the adapted eTPs in terms of their common TP\\ncharacteristics (see Table E.4 in Appendix E.2) and the initial\\nblueprints.\\n</p>\\n<p>The likeliness that customers would use e-service\\ntouchpoints\\n</p>\\n<p>This section covers the “Data Collection” phase and also the\\nfirst analytical elements (i.e., the “Descriptive Statistics”). As\\nthis article is an extension to Betzing et al. (2019), the first two\\nsteps (“Qualitative Web Analysis” and “Blueprinting”) are\\nshortened, as this article’s focus is the subsequent statistical\\n</p>\\n<p>analysis and interpretation. Further details on these steps can\\nalso be found in the Appendices B and C.\\n</p>\\n<p>Identification of dominant e-service touchpoints\\n</p>\\n<p>Since no comprehensive scientific overview of potential eTPs\\nfor BaM retail stores was found, dominant eTPs that are prom-\\nising for adaptation in the physical retail servicescape were\\nderived from e-commerce. A qualitative web-content analysis\\n(Mayring 2014) was conducted following the lens of domi-\\nnant design theory, which proposes that a product category\\nestablishes a representative set of functions over time that is\\nthen accepted as standard (Suárez and Utterback 1995). This\\nlens has been applied to technological milestones like micro-\\nprocessor designs, PC operating systems, and television sys-\\ntems (Suárez 2004; Suárez and Utterback 1995). Murmann\\nand Frenken (2006) develop a generalized framework for\\ndominant design research, advancing this theoretical lens by\\nmaking it applicable not only to technologies but to multi-\\nlevel systems (Kask 2011). Therefore, as Kask (2011) argues,\\nit is even applicable to organizational systems like market\\nchannels that are comprised of various elements with different\\nmissions. The dominance of technology can be investigated\\non several levels of analysis, one of which is by considering\\n“technological artifacts as [being] composed of subsystems\\nthat are linked together [...] through specific interfaces”\\n(Suárez 2004, p. 274).\\n</p>\\n<p>E-commerce systems can be considered such artifacts, as\\nthey are digital interfaces that belong to the online channel and\\nare composed of various eTPs. As e-commerce is a mature\\ndomain (V. Kumar et al. 2017), it is fair to suppose that lead-\\ning e-commerce systems have set a dominant design that is\\ncomprised of a set of functions that represent the requirements\\nof various types of users (cf. Suárez and Utterback 1995).\\n</p>\\n<p>Fig. 4 Exemplary Service Blueprint for an Adapted In-Store Navigation (S) Touchpoint\\n</p>\\n<p>Exploring customers’ likeliness to use e-service touchpoints in brick and mortar retail 529</p>\\n<p />\\n</div>\\n<div class=\"page\"><p />\\n<p>Accordingly, the designs of the eTPs that leading e-commerce\\nsystems offer most often can be considered to be dominant\\nand that they are likely to be used in BaM retail stores as well.\\n</p>\\n<p>Therefore, the proprietary solutions of Amazon, Otto, and\\nZalando, the German e-commerce market leaders (Betzing\\net al. 2019; EHI Retail Institute 2018), were analyzed and\\nmajor instances of five widespread commercial off-the-shelf\\n(COTS) e-commerce solutions—Shopify, Magento,\\nWooCommerce, XT:Commerce, and Shopware—were\\nassessed (Betzing et al. 2019; Datanyze 2018). To address\\nvariances that may result from national peculiarities, custom-\\nization, and differing product categories, three major\\nEuropean e-commerce retailers were sampled for each of the\\nfive solutions. Thirty-five eTPs were identified from which\\nany that were not offered by at least four instances (lack of\\ncommonality) or that required an online shop for service de-\\nlivery were filtered out, resulting in twenty adaptable eTPs.\\n</p>\\n<p>Adapting E-service Touchpoints using service blueprinting\\n</p>\\n<p>Service blueprints were created to transfer the eTPs from e-\\ncommerce to BaM retail (cf. Beverungen et al. 2011).\\nService blueprinting is a well-established, customer-\\nfocused modeling method for service innovation and im-\\nprovement (Beverungen et al. 2011; Bitner et al. 2008) that\\nyields “a picture or map that portrays the [planned] customer\\nexperience and the service system, so that the different peo-\\nple involved in [its development][...] can understand it ob-\\njectively, regardless of their roles or their individual points of\\nview” (Zeithaml et al. 2017, p. 238).\\n</p>\\n<p>Figure 4 illustrates the adapted In-Store Navigation (S) TP\\nas an example of a service blueprint. Creating the service\\nblueprints involved considering the mediating technology\\nand the necessary activities to be performed by the customer\\nand the BaM retailer (as the service provider). To accommo-\\ndate customers’ use of various digital devices in accessing\\nservice, the original blueprinting method was extended with\\nan additional layer that listed the digital devices that could be\\nused to consume the service. Frequent discussion among three\\nresearchers ensured that the blueprints were (a) suitable\\n</p>\\n<p>representations of the identified eTPs and were (b) not subject\\nto excess bias.\\n</p>\\n<p>The 20 e-commerce eTPs were adapted to the 26 BaM\\neTPs, as depicted in Table 1, mostly mediated by a\\nsmartphone app. Numeric differences are due to the mapping\\napplied, which mapped some multiple-input TPs to a single\\noutput TP and vice versa, and different mediating devices—\\ni.e., terminal and smartphone—were considered for some of\\nthe TPs. The full descriptions of the adapted eTPs and their\\nservice blueprints can be found in Appendix C of this manu-\\nscript for researchers who want to reproduce (Peng 2011) and/\\nor extend this article’s contributions.\\n</p>\\n<p>To provide additional structure, each eTP was initially cat-\\negorized into one of four categories based on its value:\\n</p>\\n<p>&amp; Search &amp; Navigation: eTPs in this category are primarily\\nsolution-oriented shopping aids (Chang and Kukar-\\nKinney 2011) in the pre-purchase stage (Lemon and\\nVerhoef 2016) that assist in reducing search time and in-\\nformation overload (Betzing et al. 2019).\\n</p>\\n<p>&amp; Product Information: eTPs in this category are research-\\nsupporting shopping aids (Chang and Kukar-Kinney\\n2011) in the pre-purchase state that assist with information\\nretrieval and alternative evaluations (Betzing et al. 2019;\\nLemon and Verhoef 2016).\\n</p>\\n<p>&amp; Selection &amp; Checkout: eTPs in this category aid cus-\\ntomers in planning, conducting, and controlling past, cur-\\nrent, and future purchases (Betzing et al. 2019; Lemon and\\nVerhoef 2016).\\n</p>\\n<p>&amp; Communication &amp; Support: eTPs in this category are\\nmarketing, customer engagement, and customer care-\\ncentric eTPs that are independent of the customer journey\\nstage (Betzing et al. 2019; Lemon and Verhoef 2016).\\n</p>\\n<p>1.1.1 Survey Research Approach\\n</p>\\n<p>While the adaption of dominant e-commerce TPs appears\\npromising for BaM retailers, whether and to what extent cus-\\ntomers are likely to use them remains unclear, as “a dominant\\ndesign is not always that design which has greatest technolog-\\nical sweetness” (Suárez and Utterback 1995, p. 417).\\n</p>\\n<p>Table 1 Adapted BaM E-Service Touchpoints (grouped by touchpoint category; entries marked with “(S&amp;T)” represent two touchpoints mediated\\nthrough smartphones (S) and terminals (T))\\n</p>\\n<p>Search &amp; navigation Product information Selection &amp; checkout Communication &amp; support\\n</p>\\n<p>In-Store Navigation (S&amp;T) Product Information (S&amp;T) Shopping List Write Product Review\\n</p>\\n<p>Product Exploration (S&amp;T) App-Equipped Clerk Shopping Cart Messaging\\n</p>\\n<p>Product Recommendation Product Availability Sales-Floor Checkout Periodic Newsletter\\n</p>\\n<p>Product Comparison (S&amp;T) Mobile Self-Checkout Location-Based Newsletter\\n</p>\\n<p>Read Product Review (S&amp;T) Order History FAQ (S&amp;T)\\n</p>\\n<p>Recently Viewed Products Social Media\\n</p>\\n<p>530 B. Barann et al.</p>\\n<p />\\n</div>\\n<div class=\"page\"><p />\\n<p>Therefore, a quantitative online survey (Recker 2013) was\\nconducted to get an idea of customers’ behavioral intentions\\ntoward eTPs. Participants were first asked to imagine them-\\nselves going on a shopping trip in a futuristic BaM retail store\\nthat offers digitally enhanced services via a touchscreen ter-\\nminal and/or an app on their smartphone. Participants were\\nasked to abstract from the type of products sold and focused\\non the service offerings. Next, the eTP categories were intro-\\nduced. Throughout the survey, each eTP was introduced in\\none paragraph. For example, the Product Comparison TPwas\\ndescribed as follows: “Imagine yourself planning to select a\\nproduct, e.g., a new television, out of a set of similar options.\\nWithin the Smart Store, you can use your Companion App to\\nscan two to multiple products’ QR-Codes and compare them\\nwith each other. A table with relevant information on each\\nproduct, e.g., size, price, and technical features will be\\ndisplayed. Likewise, you can use a Terminal to compare mul-\\ntiple products by entering the product names.”\\n</p>\\n<p>The likeliness that the participant would use the eTP was\\nsurveyed using a single five-point Likert scale item (e.g.,\\n</p>\\n<p>Bernard 2013) (e.g., “How likely would it be for you to use\\nsuch a Product Comparison Service via an App?”). If appli-\\ncable, a second itemwas included to investigate the alternative\\nimplementation on a terminal. The participants were also\\nasked whether they use their smartphones to support their\\nactivities in BaM stores and how frequently they shop online.\\nParticipants provided demographic information, including\\ntheir country of origin, education, gender, and age.\\n</p>\\n<p>Since BaM retail is prevalent in society, the survey was not\\nlimited to a particular audience but used prolific.co, a\\nrecruiting platform that provides researchers with representa-\\ntive samples of participants in terms of age, gender, and edu-\\ncational level, to recruit a diverse sample of more than 300\\nparticipants aged eighteen and older who were from Western\\ncountries (Betzing et al. 2019, p. 565).\\n</p>\\n<p>An a t t en t ion-check ques t ion (adap ted f rom\\nOppenheimer et al.

The average age of the partic-\\nipants was 32.69 years (ex = 31 years, σ = 9.96 years), 53.6% of\\nwhom were women. Participants came from the United\\nKingdom (145), the United States (52), Canada (12),\\nPortugal (9), the Netherlands (4), and sixteen other European\\ncountries (28). Almost all the respondents (99.20%) reported\\nowning a smartphone, and 72.80% reported using their\\nsmartphones or tablets in stores to support their shopping pro-\\ncess. The average time participants required to complete the\\nsurvey was 9 min and 37 s. Participants received £1.15 for\\ntheir participation (Betzing et al. 2019, p. 565).\\n</p>\\n<p>Survey results\\n</p>\\n<p>Figure 5 shows the distribution of the responses to the eTPs,\\nsorted by category and in descending order by average rat-\\ning. The global average rating was 3.58 points. The Social\\nMedia TP ranked worst with an average of points, while the\\nMobile Self-Checkout TP ranked highest with an average of\\n4.35 points. The comparison of the four touchpoint catego-\\nries revealed that respondents were most likely to use the\\nselection and checkout TPs (∅ 3.92 points). Product infor-\\nmation TPs (∅ 3.79 points) and search and navigation TPs\\n(∅ 3.73 points) ranked similarly, whereas respondents were\\nmuch less likely to use the communication and support TPs\\n(∅ 2.94 points). The Social Media (σ2 = 1.71; σ = 1.31),\\nPeriodic Newsletter (σ2 = 1.64; σ = 1.28), Location-Based\\nNewsletter (σ2 =1.60; σ = 1.27), and Messaging TPs (σ2 =\\n1.48; σ = 1.22) were the most controversial (Betzing et al.\\n2019, p. 565).\\n</p>\\n<p>Six eTPs were surveyed regarding the two service inter-\\nfaces, smartphone (S) and in-store terminal (T). The results\\nshow that respondents preferred smartphones over terminals\\nby an average of .50 points, and every e-service was ranked\\nhigher when it was accessed via a smartphone app.\\nDifferences in the likeliness that customers would use the\\nsmartphone and terminal variants were lowest for the\\nProduct Exploration (S&amp;T) TPs (.26 points) and highest for\\nthe Product Information (S&amp;T) TPs (.71 points) (Betzing et al.\\n2019, p. 565).\\n</p>\\n<p>Pairwise Spearman’s rank coefficients ρ between each e-\\nservice and the respondents’ ages indicated no significant re-\\nlationships for TPs other than the TPs Product Comparison\\n(T) (ρ = .48; p &lt; .001), Read Product Review (T) (ρ = .45;\\np &lt; .01), and FAQ (T) (ρ = .39; p &lt; .01), all of which had a\\npositive relationship with age. On the other hand, the Social\\nMedia TP (ρ =−.43; p &lt; .01) had a negative relationship with\\nage. Kendall’s τb did not indicate significant relationships be-\\ntween gender and the respondents’ answers, except for a weak\\npositive relationship between female respondents and the\\nMessaging TP (τb = .16; p &lt; .01). However, women were,\\n</p>\\n<p>on average, .08 points more likely to use the TPs than men\\nwere. Although not statistically significant, women were more\\nlikely thanmen were to use a smartphone (.31 points) or an in-\\nstore terminal (.38 points) to read product reviews (Betzing\\net al. 2019, p. 565).\\n</p>\\n<p>Spearman’s rank coefficient was employed again to as-\\nsess relationships between the eTPs. Results show that TPs\\naccessed via a terminal correlated with each other but not\\nwith other TPs. Several communication and support TPs\\nhad comparatively strong relationships with each other:\\nThe Product Exploration (S) TP strongly correlated with\\nthe In-Store Navigation (S) (ρ = .51), and the Product\\nInformation (S) TP (ρ = .46). Likewise, the In-Store\\nNavigation (S) and Product Information (S) TPs were also\\nstrongly correlated (ρ = .51). A scatter plot showing the re-\\nsults of this analysis is provided in Fig. D.1 in Appendix D.1\\n(Betzing et al. 2019, p. 565).\\n</p>\\n<p>Finally, 26 ordinal logistic regressions were performed,\\neach of which considered the likeliness that participants would\\nuse one of the eTPs as the dependent variable and, as inde-\\npendent variables, the respondents’ BaM demographics,\\nsmartphone use, and online shopping frequency (see\\nTable D.1 in Appendix D.2).7 In addition to reconfirming\\nrelationships like the influence of being female on the\\nlikeliness that a participant would use the Read Product\\nReview (S&amp;T) and the Messaging TPs, the results revealed\\nfurther effects between the independent variables and the\\nlikeliness that participants would to use certain eTPs. For ex-\\nample, retail-related smartphone use was a significant predic-\\ntor of the likeliness that participants would use most eTPs.\\nOther results are considered in the discussion section of this\\nmanuscript.\\n</p>\\n<p>Factors that affect the likeliness that customers would\\nuse eTPs\\n</p>\\n<p>Exploratory factor analysis approach\\n</p>\\n<p>Overall, the relationships between the variables and the cor-\\nrelations between the BaM eTPs differed, giving a reason to\\nassess whether unobserved eTPs characteristics could ex-\\nplain these variances. Therefore, an exploratory factor anal-\\nysis (Fabrigar et al. 1999) was conducted to reveal the factors\\nbehind the likeliness that customers would use the BaM eTPs\\nin the sample. Because of this research’s exploratory nature,\\nno a priori assumptions about the characteristics were made.\\nInstead, a variety of possible eTPs were included. Still, a\\nratio of approximately five survey items to one derived factor\\nwas reached (Fabrigar et al. 1999). Regarding the suitability\\nof the sample, the response to variable ratio is in the mid-\\n</p>\\n<p>7 The regressions were calculated using the polr function of the R MASS\\npackage (version 7.3–51.6) (Ripley 2020).\\n</p>\\n<p>532 B.

The Kaiser-\\nMeyer-Olkin Measure of Sampling Adequacy (Kaiser 1970;\\nKaiser and Rice 1974) showed a “meritorious” (Hair et al.\\n2013, p. 102) score of .858, and Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity\\nalso passed with a p-value of .000 (Hair et al. 2013). In\\nkeeping with the analysis’ goal of identifying the character-\\nistics of eTPs that affect the likeliness that customers would\\nuse them, the factor extraction method was selected (Hair\\net al. 2013). A common factor analysis (CFA) with principal\\naxis factoring was chosen instead of principal component\\nanalysis (PCA) because CFA identifies latent constructs,\\nwhich results in a reflective model of factors that cause the\\nobserved variables (Costello and Osborne 2005; Gorsuch\\n1997; Henson and Roberts 2006). The frequently applied\\northogonal VARIMAX rotation was used as a factor rotation\\nmethod to identify unique uncorrelated factors (Henson and\\nRoberts 2006). An initial solution with seven factors was\\nderived based on the scree test and parallel analysis (95th\\n</p>\\n<p>percentile) (Costello and Osborne 2005; Fabrigar et al.\\n1999; Glorfeld 1995; Hair et al. 2013). Only the Product\\nAvailability and the App-Equipped Clerk TPs had loadings\\nsmaller than the recommended threshold value of .4\\n(Ferguson and Cox 1993; Hair et al. 2013). Likewise, the\\nFAQ (T) and Read Product Review (T) TPs showed cross-\\nloadings higher than .4 on more than one factor, causing the\\nalgorithm to return two factors that had just one variable\\nstrongly loading onto them. As suggested by literature\\n(Ferguson and Cox 1993; Hair et al. 2013), these variables\\nwere removed from the model. Performing these tests on the\\nreduced data revealed no issues.\\n</p>\\n<p>Fig. 6 presents the resulting factors and their loadings. This\\nfinal model explains 51.578% of the variance (see Table E.1\\nin Appendix E.1), which is larger than the threshold value\\nsuggested by Merenda (1997). Table E.2 and Table E.3 in\\nAppendix E.1 provide information on the rotated factor ma-\\ntrix, factor loadings, and the factor score coefficient matrix.\\nFig. E.1 in Appendix E.3 also shows that all eTPs described\\nby a corresponding factor significantly correlate internally,\\n</p>\\n<p>Fig. 6 Factors Affecting the Likeliness that Customers Would Use the E-Service Touchpoints\\n</p>\\n<p>Exploring customers’ likeliness to use e-service touchpoints in brick and mortar retail 533</p>\\n<p />\\n</div>\\n<div class=\"page\"><p />\\n<p>and in some cases, these correlations are comparatively\\nstrong.\\n</p>\\n<p>Exploratory factor analysis results\\n</p>\\n<p>Factor interpretation is a qualitative process that focuses on\\nthe researchers’ understanding of the survey items onto which\\na factor loads most heavily. Therefore, each survey item is\\nassigned to the factor with the highest loading and only con-\\nsidered once during the process (Hair et al. 2013; Williams\\net al. 2010). To support this interpretation, TP characteristics\\nwere derived from the literature for coding the eTPs based on\\nthe survey descriptions. Only a few studies explicitly name\\nand delimit characteristics of TPs. Table E.4 in Appendix E.2\\nexplains the adapted characteristics that were applied. In ef-\\nfect, the eTPs were coded according to the themes “content\\ndisplay” (i.e., information, promotion, support, or revenue),\\n“purpose of use” (i.e., function, diversion, or interaction),\\nand “direction of communication” (i.e., simplex or duplex)\\n(Straker et al. 2015, p. 114). They were also coded according\\nto the “ownership” (Lemon and Verhoef 2016) of the medium\\nthat grants access to the eTP (i.e., customer-owned, employee-\\nused, or retailer-owned). Finally, the eTPs were assigned to a\\nstage of the customer journey (Hoyer et al. 2012; Lemon and\\nVerhoef 2016; J. Lu 2017; Neslin et al. 2006).\\n</p>\\n<p>Three researchers independently coded the eTPs—6 cate-\\ngories with 18 features were coded for each of the 26 eTPs,\\nyielding 468 items for each coder. By means of Holsti’s coef-\\nficient of reliability (Holsti 1969), an inter-coder reliability of\\nrH = .86 was reached, which shows a strong agreement that is\\nwithin the accepted range of .8–1.0 for nominal-scaled judg-\\nment-based data (Perreault and Leigh 1989). All deviations\\nwere discussed until a consensus was reached.\\n</p>\\n<p>The characteristics of all eTPs that are affected by a specific\\nfactor were then jointly considered to support the interpreta-\\ntion process. Groups of characteristics with strong or weak\\noverlaps served as the basis for naming the factors. The results\\nof this process are discussed below.\\n</p>\\n<p>F1: External Influential Messages as Content: F1 causes\\nthe likeliness that customers will use mostly promotion or\\nsupport TPs independent of the customer journey stage, fo-\\ncusing on social aspects, recreational activities, and interac-\\ntions. The Location-Based Newsletter received the highest\\nfactor score among the touchpoints affected by F1.\\n</p>\\n<p>F2: Terminal as Medium: F2 causes the likeliness that cus-\\ntomers use functional eTPs mediated by a terminal that pro-\\nvides access to additional product or location information. The\\nCFA suggested that some of the terminal TPs were also af-\\nfected by the factors that cause the likeliness that customers\\nwill use the respective smartphone app variants.\\n</p>\\n<p>F3: Supported Product Search as Functionality: F3 causes\\nthe likeliness that customers will use functional eTPs that\\nprovide additional information for their search process during\\n</p>\\n<p>the customer journey. Within this group of eTPs, the In-Store\\nNavigation (S), which is associated with customers’ search\\nprocesses, received the highest factor score.\\n</p>\\n<p>F4: Answer Inquiries as Functionality: F4 affects the\\nlikeliness that customers will use informational eTPs, which\\nmainly answer inquiries about the selection of alternatives and\\nare shopping aids that allow customers to find the right prod-\\nucts and get answers to questions quickly.\\n</p>\\n<p>F5: Historical Customer Data as Content: F5 describes\\ntwo functional support TPs that provide access to historical\\ncustomer data. While the Order History TP informs both the\\nalternative evaluation and the post-purchase stage of the cus-\\ntomer journey, the Recently Viewed Products TP allows cus-\\ntomers to keep track of products they have already considered\\nduring their evaluation of alternatives.\\n</p>\\n<p>F6: Supported Checkout Procedure as TP Functionality:\\nF5 causes the likeliness that customers will use revenue TPs\\nthat support the purchase stage of the customer journey. They\\nprovide alternative means for the checkout process and are\\nmeant to improve shopping efficiency.\\n</p>\\n<p>F7: Supported Product Collection as TP Functionality:\\nFinally, F7 causes the likeliness that customers will use func-\\ntional eTPs that keep track of the planned and actual shopping\\nbasket.\\n</p>\\n<p>Discussion\\n</p>\\n<p>The results provide first exploratory insights into customers’ be-\\nhavioral intentions toward eTPs in BaM stores. These insights\\nhave several implications for research and practice. Overall, the\\nsurvey participants were likely to use the BaM eTPs. They pre-\\nferred TPs that aid in searching for products, finding information,\\nselecting products, or facilitating a more efficient customer jour-\\nney. In contrast, there was considerably less interest in communi-\\ncation and support eTPs. The regression showed that prior BaM\\nretail-store-related smartphone use was a significant predictor of\\nthe likeliness that the surveyed shoppers would use many of the\\neTPs. Not significantly affectedweremost of the terminal TPs, the\\nOrder History, and theWrite Product Review TPs. However, the\\nlatter two TPs were weakly but significantly positively affected by\\nthe frequency of online shopping, which also had a weak positive\\nimpact on the Product Exploration (S), App-Equipped Clerk,\\nRead Product Review (S&amp;T), Recently Viewed Products, Mobile\\nSelf-Checkout, Sales-Floor Checkout, Social Media, and the\\nLocation-Based Newsletter TPs. Males were less likely to use\\nthe Read Product Review (S&amp;T) andMessaging TPs than women\\nwere. Finally, the Sales-Floor Checkout, Shopping List, and\\nLocation-Based Newsletter TPs were negatively affected by the\\nparticipants’ education level8 (see Table D.1 in Appendix D.2).\\n</p>\\n<p>8 The results suggested a significant quadratic effect only for the Sales-Floor\\nCheckout and a quadratic plus a cubic effect only for the Shopping List TP.\\n</p>\\n<p>534 B. Barann et al.</p>\\n<p />\\n</div>\\n<div class=\"page\"><p />\\n<p>The moderate correlations between some touchpoints (see Fig.\\nD.1 in Appendix D.1) indicate a potential for bundling service\\nofferings, albeit, without an immediate need for BaM retailers to\\nact. The factor analysis uncovered seven factors that affect the\\nlikeliness that customers would use the proposed eTPs. The TPs\\nthat are described by a factor correlate (see Fig. E.1 in Appendix\\nE.3), indicating that customers could perceive the corresponding\\nTPs as being similar. The results support research that found that\\ncustomers perceive groups of eTPs as similar (Lazaris et al. 2015a,\\n2015b), and that found stronger spillover effects for similar TPs\\n(de Kerviler et al. 2016). Thus, this article provides preliminary\\nevidence that the likeliness that customers will use eTPs in BaM\\nstores is affected by the TPs’ characteristics and, so it indicates that\\nit could be reasonable to treat eTPs that form such groups similar-\\nly. The identified factors are discussed in the following.\\n</p>\\n<p>Perception of function\\n</p>\\n<p>Since its inception, e-commerce has been primarily functional\\nin nature (Noble et al. 2005), making its utilitarian benefits for\\ninformation search vital to customers (Blázquez 2014), partic-\\nularly, because the usefulness of a channel for facilitating\\nproduct information search affects the frequency of product\\nsearches and purchases through that channel (Jihyun Kim and\\nLee 2008). By complementing physical stores with eTPs, the\\ne-commerce experience can be replicated in BaM retail\\n(Mirsch et al. 2016; Roy et al. 2017; Roy et al. 2018).\\nTechnology supports the in-store shopping process and im-\\nproves the customer experience (Renko and Druzijanic 2014;\\nTyrväinen and Karjaluoto 2019; Verhoef et al. 2015). As the\\nfactor analysis indicates, the highest-rated eTPs aid customers\\nin their search, collection, and selection of products (F3, F7,\\nand F4) and or more efficient checkout procedures (F6). The\\neTPs that are affected by these factors can be considered\\nresearch-supporting and solution-oriented shopping aids\\n(Chang and Kukar-Kinney 2011) that increase customers’\\nshopping effectiveness (i.e., finding the right products) and\\nefficiency (i.e., fast service) (Blázquez 2014; Meuter et al.\\n2003).\\n</p>\\n<p>The informational and functional eTPs that are affected by\\nthe factors F3 and F7 support customers in product search and\\nretrieval. According to prior research, behavioral intentions\\ntoward mobile information search in BaM retail stores are\\ntypically affected by customers’ perceptions of its benefits\\n(de Kerviler et al. 2016). In addition, prior research suggests\\nthat the utilitarian benefits of digital TPs are more important\\nthan their hedonic benefits (Vannucci and Pantano 2019).\\nFunctional in-store technologies are shown to cause fewer\\nprivacy concerns than others and may even reduce them in\\nmobile apps, including promotional TPs (Inman and Nikolova\\n2017). However, the technology and its mediated information\\nmust be trustworthy, and customers’ privacy concerns could\\nstill limit their acceptance (Resatsch et al. 2008).\\n</p>\\n<p>F4 affects three eTPs that allow customers to gather infor-\\nmation for their evaluation of alternatives or purchase deci-\\nsions. Thus, the likeliness that customers will use these eTPs\\ncould be affected by their ability to find the right products and\\nget answers to questions quickly. The information provided\\nby these eTPs is product-related, customer-generated, and\\nbrand-generated. The survey results support extant studies’\\nsuggestion(e.g., Tyrväinen and Karjaluoto 2019) to imple-\\nment eTPs that allow customers to compare products. Also,\\nthe positive attitude of the surveyed shoppers toward the Read\\nProduct Review (S) TP is unsurprising since prior research\\nargues for the importance of direct customer-to-customer\\n(C2C) interaction in BaM retail stores (Harris et al. 1997).\\nC2C interaction also has a stronger impact on satisfaction than\\ncustomer-to-employee interaction does (Harris et al. 1997),\\nwhich, in turn, can impact customers’ attitudes about a store\\n(Lee and Lim 2017). However, the impact of digital C2C\\ninteractions like product reviews on purchase behavior in e-\\ncommerce differs based on the customer’s age (von Helversen\\net al. 2018). As channel characteristics can moderate such\\neffects, the impact of novel digitally enabled C2C interactions\\nin the smart BaM servicescape requires further investigation\\n(Libai et al. 2010). In addition, the surveyed shoppers were\\nless likely to use the FAQ (S) TP than they were to use the\\nother two eTPs. Similarly, Kim and Stoel (2005) show that,\\ncompared to other TPs in e-commerce, customer attitudes to-\\nward FAQ TPs were, on average, the lowest. Still, Kim and\\nStoel (2005) find that such TPs affect purchase intentions.\\nTherefore, further research should investigate such BaM TPs\\nin more detail.\\n</p>\\n<p>Finally, F6 affected two TPs that are concerned with alter-\\nnative checkout services. Overall, prior research finds varying\\nimpacts of perceived usefulness, the relative advantage in\\nterms of time-savings and reduced customer confusion, ease\\nof use, risks, perceived security, and compatibility on the cus-\\ntomers’ intention to use mobile self-checkout or payment\\neTPs (Aloysius et al. 2018; de Kerviler et al. 2016; Johnson\\net al. 2019; C. Kim et al. 2010; Schierz et al. 2010). In the\\nsurvey, Mobile Self-Checkout was the most prominent eTP.\\nThe participants’ online shopping frequency had a weak but\\nsignificant positive impact on the likeliness that they would\\nuse this eTP (see Table D.1 in Appendix D.2). Usually, cus-\\ntomers attach importance to and have a positive attitude about\\nself-checkout TPs (Inman and Nikolova 2017; Lazaris et al.\\n2015a, 2015b), as they provide several benefits (Renko and\\nDruzijanic 2014), including improved efficiency because they\\nare faster than their employee-operated counterparts\\n(Vannucci and Pantano 2019; Vuckovac et al. 2017). By re-\\nducing the time and effort required in shopping in BaM stores,\\nretailers can drive store patronage intentions (Baker et al.\\n2002). Time convenience was also shown to have positive\\nimpacts on customers’ perceptions of the value of the mobile\\nchannel, which encourages customers to use the channel\\n</p>\\n<p>Exploring customers’ likeliness to use e-service touchpoints in brick and mortar retail 535</p>\\n<p />\\n</div>\\n<div class=\"page\"><p />\\n<p>(Kleijnen et al. 2007). In contrast, the Sales-Floor Checkout\\nreceived lower ratings by the shoppers surveyed on average.\\nFurther research should investigate whether dependence on\\nemployees reduces customers’ perceptions of an eTP’s poten-\\ntial to save time. The participants’ prior BaM-retail-related\\nsmartphone use had a significant positive impact on the\\nlikeliness that they would use this eTP (see Table D.1 in\\nAppendix D.2). In addition, its similarity to the existing self-\\ncheckouts offered by some retailers may have positively af-\\nfected the participants’ perceptions of the Mobile Self-\\nCheckout TP, so an exposure or a spillover effect could have\\noccurred (de Kerviler et al. 2016; Zajonc 1968), which could\\nbe subject to further research.\\n</p>\\n<p>In sum, based on the findings from the survey and prior\\nresearch, BaM retailers should design and introduce easy-to-\\nuse eTPs that, depending on the industry, provide utilitarian\\nand/or hedonic benefits with low privacy concerns for the pre-\\npurchase stage (e.g., for additional store-generated, product-\\nrelated, or customer-generated information) and the purchase\\nstage (e.g., more efficient checkout services). However, con-\\nsidering prior research, in addition to customer benefits and\\nacceptance, the retailers’ benefits and outcomes should also be\\nconsidered (Inman and Nikolova 2017; Renko and Druzijanic\\n2014). In e-commerce, for example, search support, FAQs,\\nand product-comparison services can affect customers’ pur-\\nchase intentions (M. Kim and Stoel 2005). Therefore, further\\nresearch could consider the effect of eTPs on customers’ pur-\\nchase intention in BaM retail stores in more detail. For in-\\nstance, digital shopping lists can contain fewer items but result\\nin more hedonic and unplanned purchases (Huang and Yang\\n2018), and customers spend more money in BaM stores when\\nthey use the internet to search for information (Sands et al.\\n2010) and are more likely to buy fresh products if they are\\nprovided with (real-time) information via eTPs (Fagerstrøm\\net al. 2017), making such eTPs potential revenue drivers.\\n</p>\\n<p>Perception of content\\n</p>\\n<p>Content-related factors are concerned with influential external\\ninput from the retailer or from other customers (F1) and access\\nto historical customer data (F5). F1 loads onto several promo-\\ntional and support TPs that have a diversional or interactional\\nnature. Some of the TPs that are affected by F1 are among\\nthose that are least desirable.\\n</p>\\n<p>F1 affects three promotional eTPs—the Product\\nRecommendation and the two Newsletter TPs—meant to stimu-\\nlate customers to recognize needs based on previous purchases.\\nAccording to prior research, customers’ brand trust, shopping\\nstyles, and perceived value affect their intention to participate\\nin mobile marketing (Persaud and Azhar 2012). Research high-\\nlights customers’ negative sentiment toward intrusive communi-\\ncation and personalization in BaM stores (Burke 2002) and even\\nsuggests lower use intentions and stronger privacy concerns for\\n</p>\\n<p>personalized e-services in BaM retail stores than in e-commerce\\n(Wetzlinger et al. 2017). It may be for these reasons that, similar\\nto other studies (Lazaris et al. 2015a, 2015b), participants gave\\nthe Product Recommendation TPs mediocre ratings. In contrast,\\nother studies argue that customers prefer stores that offerProduct\\nRecommendation TPs and show that customers’ behavioral in-\\ntentions toward such eTPs are driven by their perceived useful-\\nness (Kowatsch and Maass 2010). Relative advantages and per-\\nsonalization are also shown to have a positive mediated impact\\n(i.e., via satisfaction and perceived risk) on customers’ behavioral\\nintentions toward retail technologies (Roy et al. 2017). Vannucci\\nand Pantano (2019) find that customers have more trust in the\\nsuggestionsmade by digital TPs than they have in thosemade by\\nhuman TPs. However, past e-commerce research suggests that\\npersonalization has no effect on purchase intentions (M.Kim and\\nStoel 2005). Future research could consider in more detail the\\nfactors affecting customers’ behavioral intentions toward BaM\\nProduct Recommendation TPs and their impact on customers’\\npurchase intentions.\\n</p>\\n<p>The Location-Based Newsletter received the second-\\nlowest average rating among the eTPs in the survey.\\nResearch on location-based retail services and apps finds\\nvarying impacts of perceived usefulness, cognitive/affective\\ninvolvement, ease of use, flow (i.e., enjoyment, control, and\\nconcentration), trust, and privacy concerns on customers\\n(Kang et al. 2015; Uitz and Koitz 2013; Zhou 2016). For\\nexample, the positive impact of affective involvement on the\\nintention to use is greater for experientially oriented customers\\n(Kang et al. 2015). Companies can also affect flow, trust, and\\nprivacy concerns, all of which can affect customers’ continu-\\nance intention through the quality of the system, service, and\\ninformation (Zhou 2016). This article’s survey results show\\nthat privacy concerns may be reflected by the average higher\\nrating of the Location-Based Newsletter TP’s periodic coun-\\nterpart. Prior research finds that different means of delivery,\\ninterface mobility, and customers’ privacy needs affect reve-\\nnues from location-based marketing differently (Banerjee\\net al. 2020). Therefore, research and practice should consider\\ndifferent design options, when designing location-based eTPs.\\n</p>\\n<p>F1 also affects three supportive TPs that are of a\\ndiversional and interactional nature (cf. Straker et al.\\n2015). Aside from its potential to reduce the frustration\\nof finding store employees, the likeliness that the sur-\\nveyed shoppers would use the Messaging TP, which is\\nnot bound to a specific stage of the customer journey,\\nwas lower on average than twenty of the other eTPs. In\\nan e-commerce context, prior research shows that ser-\\nvice quality and customer satisfaction have indirect im-\\npacts (i.e., via perceived usefulness and ease of use) on\\ncustomers’ acceptance of support chats (Elmorshidy\\n2013). However, customers usually attach more impor-\\ntance to personal contact in BaM retail s tores\\n(Schramm-Kle in e t a l . 2007) and prefe r C2C\\n</p>\\n<p>536 B. Barann et al.</p>\\n<p />\\n</div>\\n<div class=\"page\"><p />\\n<p>interactions over customer-to-employee interactions\\n(Harris et al. 1997). These preferences might explain\\nthe lower rating of the eTP in this regard, as an eTP\\nmight be seen as impersonal and lacking direct human\\ninteraction. Further research could investigate the impact\\nof these preferences in more detail.\\n</p>\\n<p>TheWrite Product Review TP is the fourth least likely to be\\nused, and the Social Media TP the least likely. However, prior\\nresearch shows that social media can affect purchase decisions\\nin BaM retail stores. The trust and loyalty of several customer\\nsegments are affected by user-generated content differently\\n(Beurer-Züllig and Klaas 2020), so such TPs should not be\\noverlooked. For example, in fashion retail, in addition to per-\\nceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment is an essential deter-\\nminant of customers’ behavioral intentions toward various\\neTPs, including social media (H.-Y. Kim et al. 2017).\\nSimilarly, Weinhard et al. (2017) find that customers’ hedonic\\nmotivations have a strong impact on behavioral intentions and\\nthat the customers’ willingness to provide personal informa-\\ntion is almost as important.\\n</p>\\n<p>In sum, F1 affects stage independent, post-purchase, and\\npre-purchase TPs that allow customers to create user-\\ngenerated and consume brand-generated content. F1 could\\nindicate that BaM shoppers are still critical of personalized\\nand intrusive communication (cf. Burke 2002) in a hybrid\\nBaM servicescape and, so they perceive eTPs that enable them\\nto influence other customers as being similar to those that try\\nto influence them through brand-generated content. F1 could\\nalso indicate that customers perceive eTPs, which comple-\\nment the activities along the traditional BaM customer jour-\\nney, as less useful than those supporting existing activities.\\n</p>\\n<p>The second content-related factor (F5) affects the likeliness\\nthat customers will use two functional eTPs that give them\\naccess to historical customer data, thus supporting the alterna-\\ntive evaluation and post-purchase stages. Both eTPs received\\nmoderate ratings from the surveyed shoppers. The frequency\\nof online shopping had a weak positive impact on the Order\\nHistory and the Recently Viewed Products TPs, and the latter\\nwas also significantly affected by prior BaM-retail-related\\nsmartphone use (see Table D.1 in Appendix D.2). Either the\\nshoppers perceived these TPs as less intrusive (cf. Burke\\n2002) than those affected by F1, or they perceived more ad-\\nvantage from and control over them (cf. Roy et al. 2017).\\nFurther research could investigate customers’ perceptions of\\nthe collection, presentation, and analysis of customer data in\\nthe context of various BaM eTPs in more detail.\\n</p>\\n<p>Considering the survey results and the findings of prior\\nresearch, BaM retailers should implement non-intrusive pro-\\nmotional and interactional TPs that customers perceive as use-\\nful and enjoyable, and that consider their privacy needs.When\\neTPs use historical data, BaM retailers should consider cus-\\ntomers’ perceptions of the eTPs’ usefulness and customers’\\ncontrol over them.\\n</p>\\n<p>Perception of medium\\n</p>\\n<p>Finally, one factor (F2) is concerned with the terminal as an\\naccess medium. On average, the terminal-based eTPs received\\na lower rating by the surveyed shoppers than their\\nsmartphone-based counterparts. Thus, the survey results sug-\\ngest that customers might prefer using their smartphones to\\naccess eTPs in BaM stores. Prior research suggests that mobile\\nshopping technologies facilitate customer-retailer intercon-\\nnectedness, consumer empowerment, and proximity- as well\\nas web-based consumer engagement (Faulds et al. 2018).\\nHowever, older customers may still be more likely to favor a\\nterminal or human-mediated eTPs (see Table D.1 in Appendix\\nD.2), as they may be less confident using modern and sophis-\\nticated self-service technologies (Dean 2008; Y.-S. Wang and\\nShih 2009) and may miss human interaction when they eval-\\nuate self-service technologies (Dean 2008). Additional re-\\nsearch could investigate older customers’ expectations about\\nthe media used to convey eTPs.\\n</p>\\n<p>In addition to customers’ age, prior research discusses several\\nreasons for customers’ preference for one medium over another.\\nSimilar to the impact of media richness on the fit with a task and\\nthe overall choice of a channel (Maity and Dass 2014), media\\nrichness, which varies across devices (Rieger and Majchrzak\\n2018), may affect customers’ perceptions and acceptance of\\neTP interfaces. The interfaces used to access electronic channels\\nvia devices also affect customers’ evaluations of these channels\\n(Wagner 2015). Furthermore, prior research shows that the task-\\ntechnology-fit affects customers’ utilitarian motivations to use e-\\ncommerce (Klopping and McKinney 2004) and their perception\\nof the usefulness, ease of use, and convenience of online channel\\ninterfaces (Wagner 2015). Moreover, the type of device in e-\\ncommerce affects customer engagement, increases the impact\\nof their perceptions of the risk associated with their purchase\\ndecisions (Cozzarin and Dimitrov 2016), and moderates the re-\\nlationships between their perceptions of the e-business\\ntechnology’s usefulness and their attitudes toward it (Sumak\\net al. 2017). According to Natarajan et al. (2018), the type of\\ndevice moderates the impact of perceived usefulness and\\nenjoyment on the intention to use mobile shopping apps.\\nSimilarly, Aloysius et al. (2018) show that the relationship be-\\ntween ease of use of and the intention to use a mobile self-\\ncheckout is significant only in a mobile scanning and stationary\\npayment scenario. This finding indicates that the mobility of the\\nmedium used to access an eTP in BaM stores could moderate\\nthis relationship under certain circumstances. Finally, besides in-\\nstore terminals, smartphones, and other digital interfaces\\n(Betzing et al. 2018; Willems et al. 2017), humans can act as\\nmediators of BaM eTPs, as illustrated by the App-Equipped\\nClerk and the Sales-Floor Checkout TPs. Especially as the ori-\\nentation of customers toward personal communication and con-\\ntact is stronger in BaM stores than it is in e-commerce stores\\n(Schramm-Klein et al. 2007), human interfaces for e-service\\n</p>\\n<p>Exploring customers’ likeliness to use e-service touchpoints in brick and mortar retail 537</p>\\n<p />\\n</div>\\n<div class=\"page\"><p />\\n<p>provision should not be neglected. However, Vannucci and\\nPantano (2019) suggest that customers have more trust in digital\\nTPs than they do in human TPs. While self-service interfaces\\nmight reduce the frequency of interpersonal interactions, they\\nprovide alternatives to the human service interface and increase\\nthe quality of customer-to-employee interactions (Pantano and\\nMigliarese 2014). Therefore, future research could investigate\\nwhich media is most suitable for accessing specific groups of\\neTPs in BaM retail stores. BaM retailers, too, should consider\\nthe type of media and interfaces when they design eTPs and\\nidentify the most suitable options for their customers in their\\ngiven context.\\n</p>\\n<p>While prior research finds that the evaluation of service\\nofferings is significantly more important for customers in e-\\ncommerce settings, it also suggests that there are no differ-\\nences in the service orientations of BaM and e-commerce\\ncustomers (Schramm-Klein et al. 2007). Furthermore, in a\\nsmart servicescape (Sanjit K. Roy et al. 2019), experience\\nwith technology has a mediating impact on customers’ behav-\\nioral intentions toward such technologies and their loyalty\\ntoward the retailer (Roy et al. 2017). The variables that are\\nknown from channel choice and technology acceptance stud-\\nies in an e-commerce context are also shown to affect the\\npurchase intention in omni-channel environments (Juaneda-\\nAyensa et al. 2016; Kazancoglu and Aydin 2018; Susanto\\net al. 2018). Therefore, considering customers’ perceptions\\nof individual eTPs in BaM retail and the determinants of cus-\\ntomers’ behavioral intentions toward eTPs along the BaM\\ncustomer journey has value. Future research could assess the\\npotential of adapting existing theoretical models (e.g.,\\nTaherdoost 2018) and research to eTPs in BaM retail stores.\\n</p>\\n<p>Conclusion\\n</p>\\n<p>An understanding of customers’ behavioral intentions toward\\neTPs in BaM retail stores is useful for researchers and practi-\\ntioners alike, given the increasing number of potential TPs\\n(Lewis et al. 2014; von Briel 2018), more complex omni-\\nchannel customer journeys (Barwitz and Maas 2018), and\\nthe risks and costs that are associated with the implementation\\nof digital channels and technologies (Karjaluoto and\\nHuhtamäki 2010; Pantano 2014). As empirical research is\\nrequired to inform theory and promote retailers’ adoption\\nand customers’ intentions toward these TPs, this article makes\\ntwo contributions:\\n</p>\\n<p>First, the study uses a survey to provide an overview of the\\nlikeliness that customers would use BaM TPs that are adopted\\nfrom e-commerce and conceptually adapted for the use in\\nBaM retail stores. Second, based on an EFA, first exploitative\\ninsights on the factors that cause customers’ behavioral inten-\\ntions toward BaM eTPs are discussed as a foundation for\\nfuture research. From a managerial perspective, the results\\n</p>\\n<p>inform BaM retailers about issues that should be considered\\nwhen they implement eTPs. From a theoretical perspective,\\nthis article contributes insights about customers’ behavioral\\nintentions toward eTPs in BaM retail stores and suggests tak-\\ning a closer look at TPs to clarify customers’ acceptance of\\ninterfaces and, ultimately, their choice of channel. As the re-\\nsults suggest that customers perceive groups of eTPs as sim-\\nilar in BaM retail stores, this article also guides future research\\nin investigating the eTPs that form such groups simultaneous-\\nly or treat them in a similar manner.\\n</p>\\n<p>This article’s exploratory multi-method approach comes with\\ncaveats and limitations that leave room for further research. First,\\nthis study is agnostic to contextual factors of the physical\\nservicescape like the size of the store, the retailer’s assortment,\\nand its location. The survey captured the likeliness that the par-\\nticipants would use dominant eTPs in an online survey based on\\nsimple textual descriptions (cf. Aloysius et al. 2018; Inman and\\nNikolova 2017; Kleijnen et al. 2007) concerned with an abstract\\nBaM store instead of in a prototype-based lab experiment. Thus,\\nthe results derived from the generic yet artificial setting of this\\nstudy should not be transferred to a real-world situation without\\ncritical reflection. The eTPs’ relevance to customers might differ\\nbased on omitted contextual factors like goods sold or certain\\nstore properties. For example, hedonic eTPs might be especially\\nuseful in fashion retail (H.-Y. Kim et al. 2017), whereas the\\nusefulness of product information TPs might be related to the\\ncomplexity of the product sold (Resatsch et al. 2008). Therefore,\\nfuture research should consider BaM eTPs against the backdrop\\nof different product categories, store sizes, and competitive strat-\\negies (e.g., service quality leadership vs. cost optimization)\\n(Porter 1998). While such contextual factors reveal paths for\\nfuture research, the generic setting of this manuscript’s explor-\\natory multi-method approach, which is independent of such de-\\nterminants, can be regarded as an unbiased greenfield approach\\nto identifying and investigating potentially useful eTPs.\\n</p>\\n<p>Second, while the textual eTP descriptions allowed cus-\\ntomers’ general intentions toward a variety of BaM eTPs to be\\ninvestigated, the impact of detailed eTPs design characteristics\\nwas not taken into account. Future research could evaluate var-\\niants of eTP implementations in lab experiments or BaM stores\\nand assess the effect of such design characteristics. By working\\nwith real instantiations of eTPs, such studies could integrate the\\nlikeliness of customers’ using individual TPs into existing survey\\ninstruments. Such studies should also pay attention to the inter-\\ndependencies among the TPs available in the given scenario by\\nconducting, for example, a conjoint analysis.\\n</p>\\n<p>Third, no a priori assumptions on the TPs’ characteristics\\nwere made—instead, a variety of possible eTPs were\\nincluded—so the identified factors should not be considered\\ncollectively exhaustive but as first insights into the determi-\\nnants of customers’ behavioral intention toward eTPs in a\\nhybrid servicescape that mirrors e-commerce experiences in\\nBaM retail stores. Future work on both TP characteristics in\\n</p>\\n<p>538 B. Barann et al.</p>\\n<p />\\n</div>\\n<div class=\"page\"><p />\\n<p>general and their impact on behavioral intentions in BaM re-\\ntail stores in particular is needed.\\n</p>\\n<p>Fourth, this study took a static view (Kranzbühler et al.\\n2017) on firm-controlled (Becker and Jaakkola 2020) eTPs\\nin BaM stores. Future research could consider a dynamic,\\nrelationship-oriented view (Kranzbühler et al. 2017) to inves-\\ntigate the spillover effects (de Kerviler et al. 2016) between\\neTPs within and across different customer journeys. Future\\nresearch could also look into selection and design criteria for\\nBaM eTPs from an organizational perspective (Inman and\\nNikolova 2017; Kranzbühler et al. 2017) or consider non-\\ncontrollable eTPs that reside outside company borders\\n(Becker and Jaakkola 2020). In addition, instead of BaM\\nsmartphone use and online shopping frequency, future re-\\nsearch could investigate the impact of prior experiences with\\nspecific eTPs on behavioral intentions in and across various\\nchannels.\\n</p>\\n<p>Finally, future research could investigate whether a set of\\ntypical BaM eTPs could eventually prevail by using the mul-\\ntiple case study method (Recker 2013) to identify a general-\\nizable dominant design (Suárez and Utterback 1995) of BaM\\neTPs.\\n</p>\\n<p>In sum, this manuscript lays the foundation for a better\\nunderstanding of customers’ interaction choices (Barwitz\\nand Maas 2018) in the smart BaM servicescape (Sanjit K.\\nRoy et al. 2019) and offers ample opportunities for further\\nresearch.\\n</p>\\n<p>Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary\\nmaterial available at https://doi.org/10.1007/s12525-020-00445-0.\\n</p>\\n<p>Acknowledgments This paper was developed in the research project\\nsmartmarket2, which is funded by the German Federal Ministry of\\nEducation and Research (BMBF), promotion sign 02K15A074.
